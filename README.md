# Bike Sales Analysis (Excel)

## Project overview

* The company needs to increase employee performance levels.
* This data analysis will help HR determine what needs to be improved or not.
* Employees were evaluated by termination reason, recruitment source, performance score, salary, absences, and hire date.
* This analysis was done on a database with 312 values using Ms. Excel only.

## Objectives:
### Questions that will drive the analysis
* What are the reasons why people abandon their jobs?
* What are our most effective recruiting channels?
* Which gender and department get the greatest pay?
* Which Department is the highest paid?
* Which age year range had the highest performance score?
* Who are the top 20 absentees that will be fired?
* Date of most hired positions?
* How many employees need to be improved based on their age range and department?

## Preparation and transformation data:
The data shows the Bike_Sales_Raw. You can see the raw data in this [Link]. As you can see in the image below, the data format is already quite cleaned. We just need to convert it into a table format to facilitate the analysis process.


The activities performed were the following:
1. Create a format table in a row dataset
2. blabla
3. blabla


## Data analysis:
Most of this analysis used Excel pivot tables and visualizations considering the target questions.

* What 
* Which 
* Who
* When
* Where 
* How

## Visualization:
Finally, we get a dashboard with 1 sheet showing bike sales performance. You can see the dashboard below and access the document by clicking this [Link].
