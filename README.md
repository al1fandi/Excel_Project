# Bike Sales Analysis (Excel)

## Project overview

* An bike store needs to increase its profits.
* Bike sales evaluated by customer overview (income, commute distance, age bracket, education and region).
* Marketing target is found by evaluating the customer characteristics.
* This analysis was done on a dataset with 1,000+ values using Ms. Excel only.

## Objectives:
### Questions that will drive the analysis
* What is the average customer income when making a purchase?
* What is the amount of each commute distance between customers who make a purchase and those who do not?
* Which age category makes the most purchases? 

## Preparation and transformation data:
The data shows the Bike_Sales_Raw. You can see the raw data in this **[Link](https://github.com/al1fandi/Excel_Project/blob/ca945d3aa5f073576e3e23f254f25cf3cc912b56/Bike_Sales_Raw.xlsx)**. As you can see in the image below, the data format is already quite cleaned. We just need to convert it into a table format to facilitate the analysis process.

The activities performed were the following:
1. Create a format table in a row dataset
2. Create a new column to facilitate the analysis process


## Data analysis:
Most of this analysis used Excel pivot tables and visualizations considering the target questions.

* What is the average customer income when making a purchase?

* What is the amount of each commute distance between customers who make a purchase and those who do not?

## Visualization:
Finally, we get a dashboard with 1 sheet showing bike sales customer overview. You can see the dashboard below and access the document by clicking this **[Link](https://github.com/al1fandi/Excel_Project/blob/ca945d3aa5f073576e3e23f254f25cf3cc912b56/Bike%20Sales%20Analysis%20(Excel).xlsx)**.

## Conclusions:
* Customers who make purchases have a higher income than those who do not make purchases. This finding can be a further consideration to target customers with income above $55,000 for marketing.
* Customers often use bicycles for trips between 0-1 and 2-5 miles. This finding indicates that bikes may only be used for everyday purposes like shopping and commuting to work and college.
* Middle age customers make most purchases. This age group will be the focus of marketing efforts.
