# Bike Sales Analysis (Excel)

## Project overview

* The company needs to increase employee performance levels.
* This data analysis will help HR determine what needs to be improved or not.
* Employees were evaluated by termination reason, recruitment source, performance score, salary, absences, and hire date.
* This analysis was done on a database with 312 values using Ms. Excel only.

## Objectives:
### Questions that will drive the analysis
* Bagaimana rata-rata penghasilan customer ketika melakukan pembelian.
* Berapakah jumlah masing-masing jarak tempuh antara customer yang melakukan pembelian dan tidak.
* Kategori usia berapakah yang paling banyak melakukan pembelian. 

## Preparation and transformation data:
The data shows the Bike_Sales_Raw. You can see the raw data in this [Link]. As you can see in the image below, the data format is already quite cleaned. We just need to convert it into a table format to facilitate the analysis process.


The activities performed were the following:
1. Create a format table in a row dataset
2. Create a new column to facilitate the analysis process


## Data analysis:
Most of this analysis used Excel pivot tables and visualizations considering the target questions.
