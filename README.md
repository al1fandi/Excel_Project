# Bike Sales Analysis (Excel)

## Project overview

* The company needs to increase employee performance levels.
* This data analysis will help HR determine what needs to be improved or not.
* Employees were evaluated by termination reason, recruitment source, performance score, salary, absences, and hire date.
* This analysis was done on a database with 1,000+ values using Ms. Excel only.

## Objectives:
### Questions that will drive the analysis
* What is the average customer income when making a purchase.
* What is the amount of each commute distance between customers who make a purchase and not.
* Which age category makes the most purchases. 

## Preparation and transformation data:
The data shows the Bike_Sales_Raw. You can see the raw data in this [Link]. As you can see in the image below, the data format is already quite cleaned. We just need to convert it into a table format to facilitate the analysis process.


The activities performed were the following:
1. Create a format table in a row dataset
2. Create a new column to facilitate the analysis process


## Data analysis:
Most of this analysis used Excel pivot tables and visualizations considering the target questions.

* What is the average customer income when making a purchase.


  
* What is the amount of each commute distance between customers who make a purchase and not.


  
* Which age category makes the most purchases. 

## Visualization:
Finally, we get a dashboard with 1 sheet showing bike sales customer overview. You can see the dashboard below and access the document by clicking this [Link].

## Conclusions:
* blablabla
