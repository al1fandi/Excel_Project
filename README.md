# HR Analysis (Excel)

## Project overview

* The company needs to increase employee performance levels.
* This data analysis will help HR determine what needs to be improved or not.
* Employees were evaluated by termination reason, recruitment source, performance score, salary, absences, and hire date.
* This analysis was done on a database with 312 values using Ms. Excel only.

## Objectives:
### Questions that will drive the analysis
* What are the reasons why people abandon their jobs?
* What are our most effective recruiting channels?
* Which gender and department get the greatest pay?
* Which Department is the highest paid?
* Which age year range had the highest performance score?
* Who are the top 20 absentees that will be fired?
* Date of most hired positions?
* How many employees need to be improved based on their age range and department?

## Cleaning and preparation:
The data shows the HRDataset. You can see the raw data in this [Link]. As you can see in the image below, the data format was not appropriate for the analysis, so it had to be cleaned and prepared.

The activities performed were the following:
1. Create a format table in a row dataset
2. Change the capitalization of text in a column
3. Create the age columns for the analysis


## Data analysis:
Most of this analysis used Excel pivot tables and visualizations considering the target questions.

* What are the reasons why people abandon their jobs?
* What are our most effective recruiting channels?
* Which gender and department get the greatest pay?
* Which Department is the highest paid?
* Which age year range had the highest performance score?
* Who are the top 20 absentees that will be fired?
* Date of most hired positions?
* How many employees need to be improved based on their age range and department?

## Visualization:
Finally, we get a dashboard with 1 sheet showing general employee information and which employees need to improve their performance. You can see the dashboard below and access the document by clicking this [Link].

## Conclusions:
* There are various reasons why employees terminate their employment, but the most common is because they want to move to a new position.
* Effective recruitment sources need to be analyzed more deeply. LinkedIn is the recruitment source that produces the highest-performing employees.
* Employee salaries between females and male gender are not much different, and this proves that there is no discrimination in providing benefits from the company to employees.
* The age range of 29 to 33 years old is employees with performance that exceeds the company's target.
* Based on historical data, the year with the highest number of employee recruitment is 2014. The increase in recruitment, if necessary, will be analyzed as to what caused it.
* Based on employee grouping, there are 16 employees with below-average performance, the most in the age range of 24-28, and 10 people for the production department. It is recommended that training be given to those employees who have below-average performance.
